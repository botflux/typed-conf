You have a bunch of changes that are waiting to be committed, and your job is to analyze them and find a good commit message.


❌Don't add any emoji

✅Be concise

✅Describe the context of the change in the body

✅The title should be less than 150 characters

✅Use the humanizer skill to make the message more human.

❌Don't follow the conventional commit standard, we don't care

✅Tell me if the commit should be split in several ones, you can see that if there is unrelated things modified together.
